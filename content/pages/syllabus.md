Course Meeting Times
--------------------

Lectures: 1 session / week, 2 hours / session

Instructor
----------

Dr. John T. Germaine

Laboratory Sessions
-------------------

*   Scheduled for two hours on Wednesday but this will change after the first lecture.
*   Perform laboratory assignments in small (3 to 5 person) groups.
*   Will meet in various rooms depending on experiment.
*   We will send you email when the lab material is available.
*   Read the material before the laboratory and be prepared to do the work.

Objectives
----------

*   Make measurements of behavior of various materials used in Civil Engineering.
*   Provide physical observations to complement concepts learned in 1.030.
*   Introduce experimental procedures and common measurement equipment.
*   Exposure to a variety of established material testing techniques.

Conduct of the Course
---------------------

*   Each of the ten assignments will be done in small groups.
*   Data will be made available electronically after each lab.
*   Each person will use the data and prepare an individual report.
*   The report will be due about one week after the lab session. (We will provide specific dates.)
*   The report will be graded based on clarity, data interpretation, and presentation.

Requirements
------------

*   Attend lectures (short description of experiments).
*   Ten laboratory assignments (90%).
*   Participation, preparation, subjective evaluation, etc. (10%).

Learning Objectives
-------------------

### Top Learning Objectives

You should learn about:

*   Planning an experimental program, selecting the test configuration, selecting the test specimens and collecting raw data.
*   Documenting the experimental program including the test procedures, collected data, method of interpretation and final results.
*   Operating the laboratory equipment including the electronic instrumentation, the test apparatus and the data collection system.
*   Measuring physical properties of common structural and geotechnical construction materials.
*   Interpreting the laboratory data including conversion of the measurements into engineering values and derivation of material properties (strength and stiffness) from the engineering values.
*   Observing various modes of failure in compression, tension, and shear.
*   Observing various types of material behavior under similar loading conditions.

Measurable Outcomes (Assessment Methods; Laboratory Reports, 1.030 Quiz, Personal Evaluation)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

You should be able to:

*   Calibrate electronic sensors
*   Operate a data acquisition system
*   Operate various types of testing machines
*   Configure a testing machine to measure tension or compression behavior
*   Compute engineering values (eg. stress or strain) from laboratory measures

Laboratory Ethics
-----------------

Here are some practical applications of OUR Golden Rule:

1.  If you open, close it.
2.  If you turn it on, turn it off.
3.  If you unlock it, lock it.
4.  If you break it, repair it.
5.  If you can't fix it, call in someone who can.
6.  If you borrow it, return it.
7.  If you use it, take care of it.
8.  If you make a mess, clean it up.
9.  If you move it, put it back.
10.  If it belongs to somebody else and you want to use it, get permission.
11.  If you don't know how to operate it, leave it alone.
12.  If it doesn't concern you, don't mess with it.

Laboratory Precautions
----------------------

*   Wear Eye Protection when working with power tools or testing specimens in compression.
*   Ask when in doubt - mistakes are expensive.
*   Do not apply higher input voltage to transducer than rated value.
*   Do not apply input voltage to output leads (green and white) of transducer.
*   Check input voltage **before** plugging in transducer.
*   Disconnect transducer before turning on or off power supplies or voltmeters.
*   Never close a valve connected directly to a transducer.
*   Monitor transducer output when making physical connections.
*   Do not wash plexiglass in detergent, use kerosene.
